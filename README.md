# Testing with Enzyme

A React project where React components and redux are tested using Jest and Enzyme
Please note that Enzyme is not supported for React 18. Therefore, an [helper package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cfaester/enzyme-adapter-react-18) has been downloaded to be able to use it in this version.

### To run the tests

```
npm install
npm run test
```
